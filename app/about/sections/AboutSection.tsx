            I'm a Lead Software Engineer and Technical Product Lead with over five years
            architecting mission-critical systems across high-stakes industries. Currently,

            My approach merges deep technical expertise with product and business strategy.
            At BSure Insurance, I elevated from individual contributor to Technical Team Lead,
            guiding three junior developers while spearheading the finance division's migration
            from monolithic architecture to a robust microservice solutionâ€”transforming their
            operational capabilities and introducing automated deployment practices.

            At Vodacom Financial Services, I delivered high-impact frontend solutions for four
            VodaPay lending products, redesigning Voucher Advance from the ground up while
            maintaining legacy supportâ€”achieving significant improvements in usability,
            performance, and user satisfaction.

            I advocate for software design excellence through S.O.L.I.D principles, clean code
            practices, and enterprise-grade implementations. Beyond corporate work, I founded
            Pixelscape, building data-driven web solutions and e-commerce platforms with full
            POPIA compliance for local businessesâ€”demonstrating versatility across contexts and scales.

              Every system I design anticipates growth. From database architecture to API design,

              <br />
              Having worked across fintech and insurance, I treat security not as an afterthought
              but as a foundational principle embedded in every architectural decision.

              Technical leadership means growing others. Through code reviews, mentorship, and
